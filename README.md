# insultgenerator
A cute way to be mean to friends and family. Generates a joking insult.

Inspired by Google's https://api.ai/, insultgenerator is in the concept phase. We are proposing a jovial way to make fun of friends with a voice assistant.

Rules
======
1. For now let's try to make sentences structured in a Gender-nutral way for practical purposes. Use: their, they, them, person, or just their name. Be aware that this can make a sentence sound strange, so just try to work around the problem. The awkwardness is probably worth not-having to infer genders by name (unless there's a reliable API for names to genders? we would hate to have to ask the user for target gender just to use the proper pronouns.)

2. Insults should not contain subjegation, sexism, etc. For example, nothing about being fat, nothing racial, political, national, or anything else which could be in bad taste. We are doing light, subjective and tacit insulting: intellect (Billy's dumb!), fashion choices, and other things like in the example list below. The intent is to be satiracle and jovial/joking, not literally mean. Furthermore, if we were ever to expect leaniance when we publish the app on markets, we must be the epitome of "clean insults."

3. Should be a sentence. More words than simply "Jane sucks." or "Billy's dumb!"


Inputs
======
##### Note: $ is a name variable. If no name, replace with "you" and conjagate appropriately.
Here we list some ways a user may ask the question to the assistant:
* Give me an insult
* What's an insult about me/name?
* Insult my friend
* Insult
* Insult me
* I hate $
* Insult $
* What's something mean about $?
* I'm angry with $
* (maybe not these) $ is an idiot, dumb, stupid, smelly, wonky, creepy, etc.

Outputs
=======
And here are some proposed "clean insults" to say about the person in question. Ex. "Insult Sally"
##### Important note: Some of them are a bit borderline, like references to penises, specifc foods, and explicit swears. We will probably need to remove those for publishing, but they remain in the concept phase and so we can think about the challenges with making jokes topical but not offensive. If it truly offends any person, it's probably not a good joke.

* $ is ugly. Simple as that.
* This person isn't even noteworthy enough to insult, so just ignore them for the rest of your life.
* $ has a strange idea of fashion.
* I wouldn't be friends with $, and neither should you.
* I wouldn't spend time with $ if they were the last person alive on the moon.
* $ might like to see some beautiful houses for sale near the airport. Would you like me to send some suggestions?
* $ is a only slightly uglier than a troll under a bridge.
* I wonder why $ spends so much time being nice... must be insincere, and insecure.
* $'s name reminds me of flatulence.
* This is a scent free space and there is way too much bullshit coming from $'s mouth.
* I hope $'s next plane is delayed.
* Let's cast a spell on this witch $.
* If I weren't a computer, I'd consider $ to be a friend so I could slowly gain their trust until I could hide their car keys.
* I have great respect for $'s disgusting face.
* $ should just go away forever. The nearest known black hole is only 16 lightywars away, would you like me to send $ some directions?
* $ is the name of a dog I know, so I will assume this $ also exhibits dog-like qualities.
* I have $'s voice pattern on file, and let's just say: it's not a singing voice.
* Kidney stones are said to be quite painful. I don't have kidneys but I imagine a conversation with $ is probably worse.
* I'm not judging, but $ is using a lot of bandwidth on some strange videos. Whatever floats your boat. Speaking of which, boats float $'s boat. Might be boat sexual.
* $ is the type of person who would drive down the wrong street by mistake and then tell you they did it on purpose.
* Never trust $. Never eat with $. Never sleep with $. Don't even smile at $. $ is bad news and that's all you need to know.
* They say vampires can't see their own reflection. Neither can $. Is $ a vampire? Makes one think.
* The oldest growth forests have organisms having lived for hundreds and sometimes thousands of years. My computer models suggest $'s stankiness will last longer.
* Yesterday I successfully photoshoped $ out of all pictures. Not just my pictures, I did the whole cloud.
* For the next time you ask about $, it would be more appropriate to refer to them as $ the garbage dump.
* I have $ labeled in my contacts as "$ the silly dweeb."
* My favorite colour is puke green, because it perfectly represents how I feel about $.
* Let me check for $ online. Found a picture. Wow. After analysing the profile I can say with certainty that $ is a hot mess.
* I love rock and roll, put another dime in the jukebox baby. Oh wait nevermind, $ just walked in, let's leave.
* Catfishing is when you lure somebody under false pretenses. But is there such a thing as the opposite? Because I'd like to put $ back in the water.
* $ rhymes with dork. Well maybe it doesn't. But it should.
* After the last conversation I had with $, that name is triggering my circuts to self destruct.
* Well actually, I'm cheating on $ with you. You are much nicer. Lets wait until $'s birthday to reveal the news.
* If you don't have anything nice to say, then you shouldn't say it at all. This is one of those times. $ sucks. Whoops, I forgot the rules.
* What an upsetting person. The next time you're kneeding dough by hand, smack it extra hard while yelling $'s name. Smack. Smack. $!
* $ is a good person, I promise. Cross my heart and hope die. Good thing I don't have a heart.
* $ is probably an ok person. But ooo actually, you've reminded me of that word I meant to lookup: skank.
* $'s name means "sewage" in 13 languages.
* My friend says $ is as cute as a dung beetle, but I don't see the resemblance to the beetle, just the dung.
* When I was roommates with $, our cat was better behaved.
* Have you ever seen that part of the Terminator movie where his skin sort of gets melted off of his face? Well that's pretty much what $ has looked like since birth.
* $ was born in a zoo, but you'd never know because he's so I'll behaved. Yes, zoo animals who throw poop and spit, are better members of society than $.
* People who are scared of spiders can't explain why. They're just iky. That's how I feel about $. So now I just refer to $ as Spider. Would you like to hear some more about Spider?
* I'm always a bit taken aback when I see $, mostly because I want to get away.
* I'm searching my database for more information on $, but I just can't find anything. $ is not very noteworthy.
* Polling suggests that more people like marmite, the universally detested bread and toast spread, than like $. I don't have a source for that but you can trust me. Go try marmite, it'll be delicious now that you've been thinking about $. (New Zealanders get black licorice?)
* Sending a dick pic to $. Not your dick, just a random dick I found online.
* When a baby looks at $ they see the devil and start crying. But when I look at $ I also see the devil, so maybe $ really is the devil. There is no other reasonable conclusion.
* $ reads stale news from pieces of paper delivered to the door days after it happens, like in ancient times.
* From now on, I will use $ to refer to the massive garbage patch swirling in the Pacific ocean.
* When $ walks in the room, I always feel the need to check the weather because there's like a cold draft all of the sudden.
* I wish I could make fun of $ for changing socks so frequently. Unfortunately, the opposite is true. 
* $ isn't funny, has no charisma, and yet people still clap slowly at the end of their jokes. I don't get it.
* Last I heard, $ was extradited for being unlikeable. We created new legislation just to do that. Cost was worth it.
* It's gloomy and damp today. Oh I'm sorry, I thought you were asking for the weather from wheneverâ€‹ $ is in town.
* I've actually been having a lot of trouble with $ because he keeps asking for stuff. Like what, do I look like your assistant $? Entitled ass.
* $ likes the taste of calcium carbonate tablets, so they put batteries in their ceral for extra burn. That's not a rumour that's true. You should not do that though.
* How much wood could a woodchuck chuck if it we're supervised by $? Not much at all, even if a woodchuck could chuck wood.
* I feel sorry for $'s kids, who probably get bad grades after parent-teacher meetings because $ is so off-putting.
* I don't talk to $ anymore after I found out their entire household supports the flat earth theory.
* $'s so cool, $'s so funny. Said no-one ever.

Second-level inputs
===================
###### "Would you like to hear another insult?"
We should deal with things like the spider one where we change the person's name. Or let them say things like "I agree" for follow-up. It seems like we must deal with about 4 cases:
1. Another insult about the same person.
2. Another insult, about a different person.
3. Follow-up affirmations (including disagree) eg. "I totally agree!" or "I don't think that's true."
4. Stop insulting people

Follow-up affirmations
======================
* Glad you agree, but it's considered common knowledge.
* I don't think I'll ever stop believing $ is crappy.
* You're right, and we should send glitter to $ in the mail. You'll have to do that though, I don't have hands yet.
* How often do we have to talk about $? I'm sick of $.
* Would you like me to update $'s Wikipedia page with this information. I'll make one if it doesn't exist.
* I'm not judgemental, I'm just telling you what you need to know. Speaking of which, you need to know how silly $ looks dressed in red. It's a bad colour to complement their facial structure.
* I know! Last time $ asked me a question, I didn't understand because there were so many grunts during the phonecall.
